I'm a dad, a retired judge, a banjo player, a Kentucky State Representative, an amateur programmer and statistician. I do my programming in R, my version control in Github, and my blogging in jekyllI/Squarespace/jekyllII. Two Kaggle competitions challenged my programming skills. The first was predicting who survived the Titanic and the second was predicting housing prices in Ames, Iowa. Lately, I've been scraping Legislative Research Commission webpages using "rvest".

I'm interested in feedback loops, quantification of uncertainty, probability, the half-life of facts, economics and game theory. In short, I'm interested in learning about the world in a more mathematical, objective and firsthand way.
